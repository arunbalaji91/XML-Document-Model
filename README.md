Purpose:
This project develops an XML parsing facility that reads XML strings or text files, builds a Document object 
that can be queried for information about the XML contents, supports programmatic modification of the Document 
and can write the revisions to another XML string or file. The project uses C++ packages to: parse the input, 
build a tree-based in-memory representation of the XML called a parse tree1, and support modifications of that representation. 
This facility also supports read and write operations. 
It will also support the programmatic creation of new XML strings and files.
